This is my personal portfolio built with a futuristic elevator-themed interface inspired by sci-fi aesthetics. As you navigate through the site, each “sector” reveals different parts of who I am, from projects and skills to my resume and more. It’s not just a website, it’s a minimal yet cinematic journey where an elevator descends through my world, sector by sector. Designed to be clean, responsive, and full of personality, just like the creator behind it.
